##Risk and Money Management

###Sources of risk

* Strategy (model) risk
  Most of the backtesting issues
  Design and implementation based on statistical model
* Portfolio risk
    - Strategy correlation (Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient)
      (Consider 'rolling correlation' - correlations are not static)
* Market risk
* Counterparty (Credit) risk
* Operational risk
    - Infrastructure (technology)
    - IT
    - Regulatory and Legal changes

###Money Management

* Kelly Criterion
  Leverage: size of portfolio / account equity

###Risk Management

* Value-at-Risk (VaR)
  Estimate, under a given degree of confidence, of the size of a loss
  from a portfolio over a given time period.
    * Assumptions:
        - Standard Market Conditions
        - Volatilities and Correlations
        - Normality of Returns
        
###Cash Management

* Several (5 - 7) accounts with different base-currency?
  (Or loan the FX pair with non-US denominated instrument?)
* Cca 65 % of asset base in US debt instruments with an average duration of 2 years
  (Short-term duration, and bulk in 1 - 3 years and rolling)

###Trade Management
