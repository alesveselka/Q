* Market risk
* Counterparty (Credit) risk
* Operational risk
    - Infrastructure (technology)
    - IT
    - Regulatory and Legal changes

###Money Management

  Leverage: size of portfolio / account equity

###Risk Management

* Value-at-Risk (VaR)

    * Assumptions:
        - Standard Market Conditions
        - Volatilities and Correlations
        - Normality of Returns
