###Prediction and Inference

#####Prediction

* Parametric Model
    - require specification (assumption) of form of 'f' function 
    - OLS (ordinary least squares) in linear settings
* Non-Parametric Model
    - more flexible, but prone to overfitting

######Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

* Supervised model requires that for each predictor X(j) there is an associated 
  response Y(j)
* In Unsupervised model, there is no corresponding response Y(j) for any
  particular predictor X(j)
